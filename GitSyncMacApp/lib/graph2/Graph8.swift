//test snappy friction
//test zoom to time-levels
//test fastList with dates 👈
//Test animate graphPoint

//between zoom levels you just do random graph
//you derive the time range based on the first and last visible items in fastList
//you make a rand value list for each time zoon on app init which is consistent across time level zooming

//hock up the timeRangeDescTextComponent

//after all these works, you then figure out how to jump in and out of time levels at the point you are at.
//create padding for values tht dont exist, you need to show 7 time points but may have only commits in 1 year for instance
//try to add valuebar
//try to add the git stuff and your done
